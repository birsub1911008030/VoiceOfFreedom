            <h2>IS ALAÇATI LOSING IT’S POPULARITY?</h2>
            <p class="summary">
                
            Alaçatı, one of Turkey's top vacation destinations, has seen a decrease in the number of domestic tourists due to the recent mafia events and exorbitant price increases.

                <p>Alaçatı, one of Turkey's top vacation destinations, has seen a decrease in the number of domestic tourists due to the recent mafia events and exorbitant price increases. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The recent armed raids on nightclubs and bloody knife fights in Alaçatı disturbed the peace of the town and its local tourists. C.Y., who went to Sole & Mare Beach Clube in Alaçatı with his friends in August last summer and was an eyewitness to the incident. He escaped unharmed from the armed attack on the beach they went to. “I will now remove Alaçatı from the holiday route due to life safety reasons. We were seeing the news on social media, but we never thought it would happen to us," C.Y. said and explained what happened to him. "We went to the beach (Sole & Mare) with our friends, where we always go, everything was normal until the incident happened, at 16:00, while we were packing up, we heard a few gunshots, then shouts escalated. Nobody was hurt, but we were very scared," he said, and added, "The armed attack at the enterance of the beach, which we went to not only in the evening but also in broad daylight, while we were inside, broke our trust in both Alaçatı and the beach. Worse things could have happened to us, but we were lucky."  

 <br>
                <br>
                
                <br>
                Another reason, exorbitant prices, caused a decline in Alaçatı’s preferability. Alaçatı, which is full every year, seems will be emptier than ever this year, like it was in the summer of 2023. The price increases at the beginning of each season have run off the local tourists. Domestic tourists, who think that the prices will skyrocket with the price hikes at the beginning of the summer, are now planning to make plans abroad rather than resorting to holiday resorts such as Alaçatı and Bodrum. I interviewed one of the domestic tourists who have chose to vacation in Alaçatı or Bodrum before, B.K.  "The cost is almost the same, and yet going abroad seems more attractive. This year, instead of Alaçatı, we will go to Montenegro or Bosnia-Herzegovina,” B.K. said. Another domestic tourist, M.E.G.; "I can always go to Alaçatı, but I can't go to Thailand." "It would be an injustice to myself not to take advantage of this opportunity when the prices are like this," he said. According to the answers we received from the public, this year Alaçatı will be quieter than previous years. <br>

                    <br>
                    On this special day of the Republic of Turkey, which recently completed its 100th anniversary, Beşiktaş residents participated in an enthusiastic celebration. People gathered at the Beşiktaş shore and watched with great excitement the passage of 100 military ships of the Turkish Naval Forces through the Bosphorus. Then thousands of people went in front of the Dolmabahçe Palace, which was the meeting place for the torchlight parade, sang the Izmir March and the National Anthem with great enthusiasm and while waiting for the parade to start. Torchlight parade, which started at 19.00, lasted approximately for 2 hours, and Beşiktaş residents walked from in front of Dolmabahçe Palace to Ortaköy, with torches and flags in their hands and singing anthems. Finally, the parade ended with Edip Akbayram’s concert organized by Beşiktaş Mayor Rıza Akpolat at 21.00 in Ortaköy Square. </p>

                <p>  After the devastating earthquake in Hatay on February 6, 2023, authorities began to take precautions for the expected Istanbul earthquake. One of these was Beşiktaş Municipality. 
<br>
                    <br>
                
                <br>
               The municipality have prepared a catalog together with TMMOB Chamber of Civil Engineers Istanbul Branch, called 'How to Determine the Earthquake Safety of Buildings?’ and an informative brochure titled "How to Apply to Beşiktaş İmar A.Ş. for Preliminary Evaluation of Buildings?" With Beşiktaş Belediyesi İmar A.Ş. The catalogs were distributed to almost all Beşiktaş residents’ doorsteps, and it informed the residents about  load-bearing columns, their potential of being damaged, and the ongoing strenghtening projects for the buildings. We have asked B.B., a Beşiktaş resident, about her thoughts on the subject. “ The catalog is informative and might be sufficient to educate people. But I don’t consider this catalog as a precaution. The catalog will not help me during a possible earthquake. I wish this subject was taken more seriously and instead of saying “you can get your building checked if you wish” they would actually inspect the buildings and evacuate the damaged ones. It would make us feel much more safe.” B.B. said. The authorities have stated previously that  an earthquake in İstanbul would be much more destructive than the one happened in Hatay. It is understood that the efforts of the Municipality is not satistactionary for some of the residents of Beşiktaş. <br>
